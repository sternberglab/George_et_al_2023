## George et al 2023

This repository contains code used in George et al 2023. It is split between the two sub-projects, each of which contains its own README and documentation. 

- `typeV_tnseq_pipeline` contains the code for a modified version of the Sternberg lab's [tnseq_pipeline](https://github.com/sternberglab/tnseq_pipeline) used to process the samples in this manuscript. 
- `ngs_offtarget_analysis` contains code used to examine off-targets, including essential gene insertions, AT-richness, intersample correlations, and potential RNA-dependent off-binding sites (via Cascade).
